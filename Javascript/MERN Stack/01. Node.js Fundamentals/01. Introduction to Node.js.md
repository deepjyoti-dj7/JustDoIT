# 01. Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Asynchronous & Event-Driven**
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Handles multiple requests simultaneously
- Perfect for real-time applications

### 2. **Single-Threaded**
- Uses single thread with event loop
- Highly scalable for I/O operations
- Efficient resource utilization

### 3. **Fast Execution**
- Powered by V8 engine (C++)
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
- Optimized performance

### 4. **NPM Ecosystem**
- Largest package registry
- 1M+ packages available
- Easy dependency management

## Why Use Node.js?

✅ **Full-Stack JavaScript**: Use same language for frontend & backend  
✅ **High Performance**: Fast execution and non-blocking I/O  
✅ **Scalability**: Handles thousands of concurrent connections  
✅ **Real-Time Apps**: Perfect for chat, gaming, collaboration tools  
✅ **Microservices**: Ideal for building microservices architecture  
✅ **Active Community**: Large community and rich ecosystem

## What Can You Build?

- REST APIs & GraphQL servers
- Real-time applications (chat, notifications)
- Streaming applications
- Command-line tools
- Microservices
- IoT applications

## Node.js vs Traditional Servers

| Feature | Node.js | Traditional (PHP, Java) |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **Model** | Event-driven, Non-blocking | Multi-threaded, Blocking |
| **Concurrency** | Single thread + Event Loop | Multiple threads |
| **Performance** | Fast for I/O operations | Better for CPU-intensive |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable | Requires more resources |

---

## Quick Example

```javascript
// Simple Node.js program
console.log('Hello from Node.js!');

// Non-blocking example
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Async operation');
}, 2000);

console.log('End');

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Async operation (after 2 seconds)
```

## When NOT to Use Node.js?

❌ CPU-intensive applications (video encoding, image processing)  
❌ Applications requiring heavy computation  
❌ When team only knows blocking languages

For CPU-heavy tasks, consider Python, Go, or Rust.

## Summary

- Node.js = JavaScript runtime for server-side
- Asynchronous, event-driven, non-blocking I/O
- Perfect for real-time, scalable applications
- Huge ecosystem with NPM
- Best for I/O operations, not CPU-heavy tasks
