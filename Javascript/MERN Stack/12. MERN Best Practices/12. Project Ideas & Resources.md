## Tips for Building Projects

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with basic features
- Add complexity gradually
- Complete one feature before moving to next

### 2. Plan Before Coding
- Sketch UI wireframes
- Design database schema
- List API endpoints
- Break into small tasks

### 3. Use Git
- Commit frequently
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use branches for features
- Push to GitHub

### 4. Write Clean Code
- Follow naming conventions
- Keep functions small
- Comment complex logic
- Use ESLint and Prettier

### 5. Deploy Early
- Deploy MVP first
- Test in production environment
- Get feedback from users
- Iterate based on feedback

### 6. Build Portfolio
- Host on GitHub
- Write good README
- Deploy live demo
- Showcase on portfolio website
