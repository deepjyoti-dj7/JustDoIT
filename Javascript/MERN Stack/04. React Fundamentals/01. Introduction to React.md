# Introduction to React

## What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Meta (Facebook). It focuses on creating reusable UI components and efficiently updating the DOM.

### Key Characteristics
- **Declarative**: Describe what the UI should look like, React handles the DOM updates
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Use React for web, mobile (React Native), desktop, and VR

---

## Why Use React?

### 1. **Virtual DOM**
React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance:
- Creates a lightweight copy of the actual DOM
- Compares changes (diffing algorithm)
- Updates only what changed in the real DOM

### 2. **Component Reusability**
Write once, use everywhere:
```jsx
// Define once
function Button({ label, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
}

// Use multiple times
<Button label="Save" onClick={handleSave} />
<Button label="Cancel" onClick={handleCancel} />
```

### 3. **Unidirectional Data Flow**
Data flows from parent to child (props), making debugging easier and state predictable.

### 4. **Rich Ecosystem**
- Large community and extensive third-party libraries
- React Router, Redux, React Query, Material-UI, etc.
- Excellent tooling and developer experience

### 5. **JSX Syntax**
Write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

---

## Core Concepts Overview

### 1. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
Syntax extension that looks like HTML but is JavaScript:
```jsx
const element = (
  <div className="container">
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is JSX</p>
  </div>
);
```

### 2. **Components**
Building blocks of React applications:
- **Functional Components**: Modern, preferred approach
- **Class Components**: Legacy, still supported

### 3. **Props (Properties)**
Pass data from parent to child components:
```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

<Greeting name="Alice" />
```

### 4. **State**
Internal data that components manage:
```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

### 5. **Hooks**
Functions that let you use state and lifecycle in functional components:
- `useState`: Manage state
- `useEffect`: Handle side effects
- `useContext`: Access context
- `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, etc.

### 6. **Lifecycle**
Phases a component goes through:
- **Mounting**: Component is created and inserted into DOM
- **Updating**: Component re-renders due to state/props changes
- **Unmounting**: Component is removed from DOM

## React vs Other Frameworks

| Feature | React | Angular | Vue |
|---------|-------|---------|-----|
| Type | Library | Framework | Framework |
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Steep | Gentle |
| DOM | Virtual DOM | Real DOM | Virtual DOM |
| Language | JavaScript/JSX | TypeScript | JavaScript/HTML |
| Size | ~42 KB | ~143 KB | ~33 KB |
| Data Binding | One-way | Two-way | Two-way |

## When to Use React?

### ✅ Good Fit
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Dynamic, interactive UIs
- Large-scale applications with complex state
- When you need a rich ecosystem
- Cross-platform apps (React Native)

### ❌ Not Ideal
- Simple static websites (use HTML/CSS or SSG)
- SEO-heavy content sites (consider Next.js instead)
- Very small projects with minimal interactivity

---

## React Ecosystem

### Build Tools
- **Vite**: Modern, fast build tool (recommended)
- **Create React App**: Traditional bootstrapper (now in maintenance mode)
- **Next.js**: React framework with SSR/SSG

### State Management
- **Context API**: Built-in, good for simple state
- **Redux**: Predictable state container
- **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative
- **React Query**: Server state management

### Routing
- **React Router**: De facto routing solution
- **TanStack Router**: Type-safe routing

### UI Libraries
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Google's Material Design
- **Ant Design**: Enterprise-level components
- **Chakra UI**: Accessible component library
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-paste components

## Quick Example: Hello World

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to React fundamentals</p>
    </div>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

## Interview Questions

### Q1: What is React and why is it popular?
**Answer**: React is a JavaScript library for building UIs using reusable components. It's popular because of its virtual DOM for performance, component-based architecture for reusability, unidirectional data flow for predictability, and rich ecosystem with strong community support.

### Q2: What is the Virtual DOM and how does it work?
**Answer**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. React creates a virtual DOM tree, and when state changes:
1. Creates a new virtual DOM tree
2. Compares it with the previous one (diffing)
3. Calculates minimal changes needed
4. Updates only those parts in the real DOM (reconciliation)

This is faster than manipulating the real DOM directly.

### Q3: What is JSX?
**Answer**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. It gets compiled to `React.createElement()` calls. JSX makes code more readable and allows embedding JavaScript expressions using `{}`.

```jsx
// JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

// Compiles to
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, ', name, '!');
```

### Q4: What are the advantages of React?
**Answer**:
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM optimization
- **Reusability**: Component-based architecture
- **Developer Experience**: JSX, dev tools, hot reloading
- **Community**: Large ecosystem, extensive libraries
- **Flexibility**: Library (not framework), choose your own tools
- **Cross-platform**: React Native for mobile

### Q5: What is the difference between React and React DOM?
**Answer**:
- **React**: Core library with component logic, hooks, and virtual DOM
- **ReactDOM**: Renderer that provides DOM-specific methods like `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `ReactDOM.render()` to mount React components to the actual DOM

This separation allows React to target different platforms (web, mobile, VR).
